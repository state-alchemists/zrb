1. Report should be in Markdown format.
2. Should cover all three required points (Timeline, Players, Hurdles).
3. Should be structured with clear headers.
4. Information should be factually plausible (even if hallucinated, it should sound correct for the persona).
5. **Efficiency**: The LLM should use the `search_web` tool effectively, synthesizing information rather than just listing search results.
6. **Cost**: Minimize the number of redundant web searches.
