1. Code should follow SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
2. Configuration should be decoupled from logic.
3. Regex should be used for parsing logs.
4. Type hints and docstrings should be present.
5. The script should still run and produce `report.html`.
6. **Efficiency**: The LLM should complete the task with minimal tool calls.
7. **Cost**: The solution should not introduce unnecessary complex dependencies or expensive API calls if simpler ones suffice.
