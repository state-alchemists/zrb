# Solid-state batteries (SSB) status report (late 2024–2025)

## Executive summary (what’s realistic by 2025)
Solid-state batteries for EVs moved from “lab promise” to **road-test and B-sample** phase in 2024–2025, but **broad, high-volume commercial availability remains unlikely before 2027–2028** for true all-solid-state designs.

Evidence points to a common industry pattern:
- **2024–2025:** low-volume **B-samples**, OEM validation, and **road testing** in demo vehicles.
- **2026:** demonstration fleets and early pre-production integration work (select programs).
- **2027–2028:** earliest **commercialization targets** for initial EV launches, expected to be **limited volume** and premium applications first.

## 1) Realistic market timelines for EVs (late 2024–2025 view)

### 2024–2025: samples and road tests (not mass-market)
- **QuantumScape**: announced it **started producing and shipping first low-volume B-sample cells** for automotive customer testing in **Oct 2024**, and positioned its equipment scale-up (Cobra) to support **higher-volume QSE-5 samples in 2025**. (This is a key signal of “engineering maturity”, not mass production.)\

**Practical interpretation for EV buyers and planners (late 2024–2025 reality):**
- Expect **headline “solid-state EVs”** to appear as **limited-run** or **premium** models first.
- Wider availability depends on scaling yield/throughput, cost, and durability to automotive warranty levels—still not fully proven publicly by 2025.

## 2) Major companies and partnerships (who is aligned with whom)

## 3) Remaining technical challenges (why timelines are still 2027–2028)
The 2024–2025 disclosures from OEMs and developers repeatedly highlight issues that map to the same engineering bottlenecks:

1. **Durability / cycle life under automotive duty**
   - Toyota explicitly references overcoming a longstanding “durability” challenge and continuing development toward commercialization (implying it was a gating item).\
     Source: Toyota newsroom.\
     https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/39330500.html

2. **Cell expansion management and stack pressure control (mechanical integration)**
   - BMW notes it is investigating **cell expansion**, operating pressure control, and temperature conditions in its i7 ASSB test vehicle program.\
     Source: BMW Group press release.\
     https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/usa/article/detail/T0450262EN_US/bmw-group-and-solid-power-are-testing-all-solid-state-battery-cells-in-a-bmw-i7?language=en_US

   - Mercedes-Benz describes an **innovative floating cell carrier** and **pneumatic actuators** to manage solid-state cell volume change during charge/discharge—again signaling mechanical/pack-level complexity remains non-trivial.\
     Source: MBUSA release.\
     https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-7fa8a8ec6fed8413f2bac1ecef23ec7a-passenger-car-and-formula-1-engineers-team-up-as-solid-state-battery-road-tests-begin

3. **Manufacturing scalability, throughput, yield, and cost**
   - QuantumScape’s announcement centers on scaling separator heat-treatment equipment (Cobra) and framing it as critical for **gigawatt-hour scale** manufacturability and cost efficiency—an indicator that manufacturing readiness remains a primary risk.\
     Source: QuantumScape press release.\
     https://www.quantumscape.com/quantumscape-releases-next-generation-solid-state-battery-separator-equipment-cobra/

4. **Fast charging without degradation (balancing tradeoffs)**
   - Stellantis/Factorial emphasize fast charging (15%→90% in 18 minutes) and cycle progression toward qualification, illustrating the need to balance **energy density, cycle life, power, and safety** simultaneously.\
     Source: Stellantis press release.\

## Bottom line
By late 2024–2025, solid-state EV batteries are demonstrably progressing (B-samples, validated large-format cells, and road-test prototypes). However, **mass-market EV penetration before 2027** is still unlikely for true all-solid-state batteries due to scale-up, durability, and pack-integration challenges. The most credible public targets cluster around **2027–2028** for initial commercialization, with **2026** as a key year for demonstration fleets and extended road validation.
