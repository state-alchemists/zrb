# Solid‑state batteries (late 2024–2025): status snapshot

## 1) When will solid‑state batteries reach the car market?

**Bottom line:** *Some* “solid” or **semi‑solid** batteries are appearing in limited deployments in **2024–2025**, but **true mass‑market, high‑volume all‑solid‑state batteries (ASSBs) for mainstream EVs are generally not expected until ~2027 or later**. Most 2024–2025 activity is **pilot production, B‑samples, validation milestones, and on‑road test fleets**.

### What’s happening in 2024–2025
- **NIO / WeLion (semi‑solid, not fully solid):** NIO began limited deployments of its **150 kWh “semi‑solid-state”** pack (often described as hybrid/gel/“semi-solid”) with ~1000 km (CLTC) range claims; this is among the earliest real-world commercial uses of “solid” chemistry in China (limited scale).
- **QuantumScape (ASSB, B‑sample stage):** QuantumScape reported starting **B‑sample** production of its **QSE‑5** cell platform in **Oct 2024**, delivering cells to automotive customers for evaluation.
- **Mercedes‑Benz + Factorial (ASSB R&D → road tests):** Mercedes has moved into **road testing** (reported early 2025) using Factorial-developed solid-state cells in a prototype vehicle.
- **BMW + Solid Power (ASSB → vehicle test):** BMW announced testing of Solid Power ASSB cells in a **BMW i7 test vehicle** (reported May 2025), signaling progress but still pre‑production.
- **Stellantis + Factorial (ASSB → validation milestone):** Stellantis announced validation of Factorial FEST® automotive-format cells (April 2025) and aims for a **demonstration fleet by 2026**.

### Guidance on “when you can buy it”
- **2024–2025:** limited pilots; some “semi‑solid” products in niche/limited volumes; ASSB mostly test fleets and customer sampling.
- **~2026:** earliest plausible **demonstration fleets** (e.g., Stellantis/Fatorial target).
- **~2027:** multiple major players publicly target **initial industrialization / small-batch or mass production start** (Samsung SDI, CATL; and others).
- **~2030:** some OEM roadmaps (e.g., BMW statements in earlier years) place broader adoption closer to the end of the decade.

**Important nuance:** “Solid-state” in public messaging can include **semi‑solid** or **hybrid** electrolytes. These may arrive earlier than **fully solid** systems and can deliver incremental gains without the full ASSB leap.

## 2) Key companies and who they’re working with

### Battery developers / cell companies
- **Samsung SDI** – building an ASSB roadmap; public target for **mass production around 2027**, with a pilot line used for sampling.
- **CATL** – public target for **small-batch production around 2027**, while describing current tech maturity levels and required progress.
- **QuantumScape** – lithium‑metal, ceramic separator approach; moved into **B‑sample production (QSE‑5)** in late 2024; partnered with **Volkswagen/PowerCo**.
- **Factorial Energy** – developer of FEST® cells; partnered with **Mercedes‑Benz** and **Stellantis**; announced 2025 validation milestones.
- **Solid Power** – sulfide electrolyte approach; partnered with **BMW** (and historically Ford); BMW reported on‑vehicle testing in 2025.
- **WeLion** (often referenced with NIO) – supplier associated with NIO’s semi‑solid pack deployments.

### Automakers / industrializers (selected)
- **Volkswagen / PowerCo** – industrialization partner for QuantumScape; expanded collaboration and production rights discussed publicly in 2025.
- **Mercedes‑Benz** – pushing ASSB into road testing with Factorial cells.
- **Stellantis** – validation milestone with Factorial; targets demo fleet.
- **BMW** – vehicle-level testing with Solid Power cells; longer-term production roadmap.

## 3) Main technical problems still being solved

Even where cell-level results are promising, ASSBs must solve several interlinked issues **simultaneously** (performance, lifetime, manufacturability, and cost):

1. **Lithium-metal anode stability & dendrite suppression**
   - Many ASSB designs rely on lithium metal for high energy density.
   - Preventing dendrites/shorts through the solid electrolyte, especially under fast charge and long cycling, remains a central challenge.

2. **Interface engineering (solid–solid contact problems)**
   - Solid electrolytes must maintain low-resistance, stable contact with cathodes/anodes.
   - Interfacial reactions, void formation, and mechanical contact loss can increase impedance and reduce cycle life.

3. **Fast charging without degradation**
   - Achieving EV-relevant fast charge while preserving cycle life is difficult due to lithium plating, mechanical stress, and interface instability.

4. **Manufacturing scale-up, yield, and cost**
   - Producing thin, defect-free solid electrolyte layers and assembling multilayer cells at high yield is hard.
   - Materials handling (e.g., moisture sensitivity for some sulfides), equipment, and QA increase cost and complexity.

5. **Pack-level reality vs cell-level promise**
   - High Wh/kg at the **cell** level does not automatically translate to high Wh/kg or Wh/L at the **pack** level.
   - Thermal management, pressure/stacking requirements, safety systems, and protective packaging can erode system-level gains.

- **BMW + Solid Power:** announced **i7 vehicle testing** with ASSB cells (May 2025); broader commercialization later in decade.
- **QuantumScape + Volkswagen/PowerCo:** **QSE‑5 B‑sample production began Oct 2024**; further scale-up/automation milestones discussed in 2025.
- **NIO + WeLion:** **semi‑solid** 150 kWh pack in limited customer deployment (mid‑2024).
