I need a launch announcement blog post for our new tool, **Zrb-Flow**. 

It's basically an AI automation thing for CLI users that hooks into Docker and K8s. One cool feature is "Self-Healing Pipelines" where it fixes broken scripts.

Keep it exciting and tech-savvy. Don't forget to tell people to install it at the end. Save it as `launch_post.md`.
