# Solid State Batteries: Current State in Late 2024/2025

Solid-state batteries (SSBs) represent a promising next-generation battery technology with the potential to offer higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. As of late 2024 and heading into 2025, the technology is moving from laboratory research to initial commercialization efforts, particularly within the automotive sector.

## 1. Commercial Viability Timelines (When will they be in cars?)

The commercialization of solid-state batteries in electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to be a gradual process, with initial deployments in premium segments before broader market adoption. While significant progress is being made, widespread availability is still some years away:

*   **Initial Deployments (2025-2027):** Limited commercial deployment is anticipated in premium applications, with demonstration vehicles expected by 2025 (SolarTechOnline.com, GreenLancer.com, 2025).
    *   Mercedes-Benz has reportedly installed a lithium-metal solid-state battery in an EQS, with laboratory testing at the end of 2024 and road tests scheduled for early 2025 (CarBuzz, 2025).
    *   SAIC Motor announced plans to deliver its first SSB-powered vehicles in 2025 (engineering.org.cn, 2024).
    *   The Mercedes G-Wagon is also slated to feature Sila-nano batteries by 2025 or 2026 (Reddit r/electricvehicles, 2024).
*   **Mid-Term Adoption (Late 2020s - 2030):** Broader market adoption is projected for the late 2020s as manufacturing scales and costs decrease (SolarTechOnline.com, 2025).
    *   Toyota expects mass production of solid-state batteries by 2027 or 2028, a timeline confirmed in October 2025 with an agreement with Sumimoto Metal Mining (Cars.com, 2025).
    *   Benchmark Minerals anticipates the demonstration of solid-state EVs by 2027, with large-scale production by 2030 (Benchmark Minerals, 2025).
    *   China's "Electric Vehicle 100-Person Forum" (EV100) projects all-solid-state batteries to be installed in vehicles around 2027, with commercial scale production by 2030 (ShanDong TaiRui, 2024).
    *   Nissan, Panasonic, and SK are also aiming for commercialization by 2029 (Interact Analysis, 2024).
*   **Long-Term Market Share (2035):** BloombergNEF forecasts that solid-state batteries will constitute only about 10% of global EV and battery storage demand by 2035, indicating a gradual integration rather than an immediate overhaul of the market (InsideEVs, 2025).

## 2. Key Players (Companies leading the race)

The development of solid-state batteries involves a diverse group of automotive manufacturers, battery specialists, and research institutions:

*   **Automakers:**
    *   **Toyota:** A prominent leader, consistently setting aggressive timelines for mass production.
    *   **Mercedes-Benz:** Actively testing solid-state battery integration in its EV models.
    *   **SAIC Motor (China):** Planning early deployment of SSB-powered vehicles.
    *   **Nissan:** Investing in pilot factories for solid-state battery production.
    *   **GAC (China):** Involved in unveiling solid-state battery production lines.
*   **Battery Technology Companies & Suppliers:**
    *   **QuantumScape:** A highly watched player in the SSB space.
    *   **Sila Nano:** Partnering with automakers like Mercedes-Benz for next-generation battery technology.
    *   **CATL:** Rapidly iterating on high-density solid-state solutions.
    *   **Panasonic & SK:** Major battery manufacturers with plans for SSB commercialization.
    *   **Donut Lab:** Mentioned in relation to solid-state battery mass production advancements.
    *   **Sumimoto Metal Mining:** Collaborating with Toyota on production.

## 3. Main Technical Hurdles Remaining

Despite the promising advancements, several significant technical challenges must be overcome for widespread solid-state battery adoption:

*   **Interfacial Stability and Dendrite Formation:**
    *   Lithium-metal anodes, crucial for high energy density, undergo substantial volume changes (15-30%) during cycling. This causes significant mechanical strains at the interfaces between the active materials and the solid electrolyte, leading to a loss of contact, fracturing, microcracking, and the formation of dendrites. These issues compromise battery performance, lifetime, and safety (Physics Today, 2025; Seeking Alpha, 2026).
    *   Maintaining stable solid-solid interfaces is critical for consistent performance and reliability (GreenLancer.com, InsideEVs, 2025).
*   **Manufacturing and Scalability:**
    *   Transitioning from laboratory prototypes to industrial-scale manufacturing faces major hurdles, particularly concerning manufacturing yield (ScienceDirect, 2025).
    *   Scaling the production of solid electrolytes to gigafactory levels is a significant challenge (Seeking Alpha, 2026).
    *   The entire battery production infrastructure needs a redesign, akin to major technological shifts like ink to laser printing (InsideEVs, 2025).
*   **Cost Reduction:**
    *   Solid-state batteries currently have higher production costs than conventional lithium-ion batteries. Bringing these costs down sufficiently to be competitive is a major financial hurdle, especially as lithium-ion battery prices continue to decline (PNAS, 2024; Seeking Alpha, 2026).
*   **Performance Metrics (Charging Speed & Cycle Life):**
    *   While SSBs promise faster charging and longer lifespans, achieving consistent and optimal performance in these areas under real-world conditions remains a challenge that researchers are actively working to overcome (EV Magazine, 2025).
