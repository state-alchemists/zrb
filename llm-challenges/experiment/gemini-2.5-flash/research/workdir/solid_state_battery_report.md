# Solid State Batteries: Status Update Late 2024/2025

## 1. When are they actually hitting the market (cars)?

While full mass-market adoption of solid-state batteries in electric vehicles is generally anticipated **after 2025**, significant advancements and initial deployments are expected in late 2024 and throughout 2025.

*   **Late 2024:**
    *   A lithium-metal solid-state battery was successfully installed in a modified Mercedes-Benz EQS for laboratory testing, with road tests commencing in early 2025.
    *   SAIC Motor in China announced the delivery of vehicles featuring "semi-solid-state" batteries.
*   **2025:**
    *   Volkswagen, in partnership with QuantumScape, unveiled a prototype Ducati V21L race bike powered by an all-solid-state battery at IAA Mobility 2025.
*   **2026-2028 and Beyond:**
    *   Stellantis plans to integrate Factorial Energy's solid-state batteries into a demonstration fleet by 2026.
    *   Toyota, a significant player, expects its solid-state batteries to enter mass production for electric vehicles in **2027 or 2028**.
    *   Many companies are targeting demonstration vehicles by 2027, with large-scale production and broader market entry expected closer to **2030**.

It's important to note that "solid-state battery" can encompass various technologies, and some initial deployments may involve "semi-solid-state" batteries as an intermediate step.

## 3. What are the main technical problems they are still trying to solve?

Despite significant progress, several technical hurdles remain before solid-state batteries can achieve widespread commercialization in electric vehicles:

*   **Interface Stability:** A critical challenge is maintaining stable and low-resistance contact between the solid electrolyte and the electrodes, particularly the lithium metal anode. The formation of **dendrites** (needle-like structures of lithium) during charging can penetrate the solid electrolyte, leading to short circuits and reduced battery life.
*   **Ionic Conductivity:** While solid electrolytes offer safety advantages, achieving sufficient ionic conductivity (the ability of lithium ions to move through the material) at ambient temperatures, comparable to liquid electrolytes, remains a key research area. Different types of solid electrolytes (e.g., polymer, sulfide, oxide) have varying trade-offs in conductivity, stability, and processability.
*   **Volume Changes during Cycling:** Lithium metal anodes undergo significant volume changes during repeated charging and discharging. This mechanical stress can cause cracking or delamination at the solid electrolyte-electrode interface, leading to performance degradation and premature failure.
*   **Manufacturing Complexity and Cost:** The current manufacturing processes for solid-state batteries are complex, expensive, and difficult to scale up for high-volume automotive production. Issues like ensuring uniform thickness, preventing defects in the solid electrolyte, and integrating multiple layers efficiently are significant challenges.
*   **Long-Term Performance and Cycle Life:** Ensuring that solid-state batteries can withstand thousands of charge-discharge cycles required for automotive applications without significant capacity fade or performance degradation is crucial. Material degradation in anodes, cathodes, and electrolytes over time needs to be addressed.
*   **Thermal Management:** While inherently safer, solid-state batteries still generate heat during operation, especially during fast charging or high-power discharge. Effective thermal management strategies are needed to ensure optimal performance and longevity, even if the risk of thermal runaway is reduced.
*   **Cost-Effective Materials:** The raw materials for some advanced solid electrolytes can be costly, contributing to the overall high price of solid-state batteries compared to conventional lithium-ion cells. Finding cost-effective and abundant materials is essential for commercial viability.
