# Solid State Batteries: Status Update Late 2024/2025

**1. When are they actually hitting the market (cars)?**

While some limited deployments and testing are occurring in late 2024 and early 2025, widespread mass production of solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is generally anticipated **after 2025**, with some projections extending to **2027-2030** for larger-scale adoption.

*   **Late 2024/Early 2025:**
    *   A lithium-metal solid-state battery was installed in a modified Mercedes-Benz EQS at the end of 2024, with road tests scheduled for early 2025.
    *   SAIC Motor announced in September 2024 that it would deliver its first vehicles with "semi-solid" batteries.
    *   Honda plans to start a demonstration line for all-solid-state batteries in early 2024.
*   **Beyond 2025:**
    *   The solid-state battery market is expected to "take off" after 2025, with small-scale production potentially happening sooner.
    *   Toyota expects mass production in 2027 or 2028.
    *   Nissan aims to launch an EV with all-solid-state batteries by fiscal year 2028.
    *   BYD plans small batches by 2027, expanding to mass-market EVs later.
    *   Production cars with solid-state batteries are expected on roads before the 2030s, but not in high volumes until the 2030s.

**2. Who are the big companies involved?**

Many major automotive manufacturers and battery developers are heavily invested in solid-state battery technology:

*   **Automakers:** Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, SAIC Motor, Honda, Nissan, Volkswagen (partnering with QuantumScape), BYD, Stellantis (partnering with Factorial Energy).
*   **Battery Developers/Suppliers:** QuantumScape (US), Solid Power (US - focusing on sulfide-based electrolytes, partnered with SK Innovation), CATL (China), Sunwoda (China), Factorial Energy, Blue Solutions (France - part of Bolloré Group), Panasonic, Samsung SDI.

**3. What are the main technical problems they are still trying to solve?**

Several key technical challenges remain before solid-state batteries can be widely adopted:

*   **Durability and Cycle Life:** Early solid-state designs struggled with durability due to expansion and contraction within the cell during repeated charging and discharging, leading to performance degradation over time. Maintaining stable performance over many charge cycles is critical.
*   **Manufacturing Costs and Scalability:** The production processes for solid-state batteries are complex and currently expensive. Achieving cost-effective mass production at a scale required for the automotive industry is a significant hurdle.
*   **Solid Electrolyte Interface:** Ensuring a stable and efficient interface between the solid electrolyte and the electrodes (especially the lithium metal anode) is crucial to prevent dendrite formation and maintain performance.
*   **Ionic Conductivity:** While solid electrolytes offer safety advantages, achieving ionic conductivity comparable to liquid electrolytes at various operating temperatures is an ongoing challenge.
*   **Integration Challenges:** Integrating solid-state battery packs into existing vehicle architectures and thermal management systems requires further development.
*   **Material Selection:** Optimizing the materials for solid electrolytes and electrodes to balance performance, cost, and safety remains an active area of research.
