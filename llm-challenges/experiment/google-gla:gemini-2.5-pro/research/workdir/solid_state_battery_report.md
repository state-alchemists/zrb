# Solid-State Battery Status Report: Late 2024/2025

## 1. Market Readiness: When are they hitting the market?

For the automotive sector, the rollout of solid-state batteries is happening in two waves: semi-solid-state and all-solid-state.

*   **Semi-Solid-State:** These batteries are already on the market, primarily in China. Automakers like Nio and SAIC Motors (through its IM Motors and MG brands) have EVs available with semi-solid-state batteries. These batteries offer improved energy density and safety over traditional lithium-ion batteries but still contain a small amount of liquid electrolyte.
*   **All-Solid-State:** This is the "holy grail" of battery technology, and it is still a few years away from mass-market commercialization. Most automakers are targeting the **2027-2030 timeframe** for the first production vehicles with all-solid-state batteries. Early rollouts may be in premium or niche vehicles, such as sports cars or luxury sedans. Some smaller applications, like motorcycles, may see commercial availability as early as 2026.

## 2. Who are the big companies involved?

The development of solid-state batteries is a global effort with a mix of established automakers, battery manufacturers, and startups.

*   **Automakers:**
    *   **Toyota:** A long-time leader in solid-state battery patents, targeting a 2027-2028 release.
    *   **Nissan:** Aiming for commercialization by fiscal year 2028.
    *   **Honda:** Developing its own all-solid-state battery, with a target of the second half of the decade.
    *   **BMW:** Testing all-solid-state cells from Solid Power in a prototype i7.
    *   **Mercedes-Benz:** Testing semi-solid-state batteries from Factorial in a prototype EQS.
    *   **Volkswagen:** Partnered with QuantumScape for all-solid-state battery development.
    *   **Hyundai-Kia:** Taking a more cautious approach, with a post-2030 timeline.
    *   **Chinese Automakers (Nio, SAIC, Dongfeng):** Already deploying semi-solid-state batteries in production vehicles.

*   **Battery Developers and Startups:**
    *   **Solid Power:** Partnered with BMW.
    *   **QuantumScape:** Backed by Volkswagen.
    *   **Factorial Energy:** Working with Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis.
    *   **ProLogium:** Partnered with Rimac.
    *   **Beijing WeLion New Energy Technology:** Supplier for Nio.
    *   **Suzhou QingTao Power Technology:** Supplier for SAIC's IM Motors.
    *   **Ganfeng Lithium:** Working with Dongfeng.

## 3. What are the main technical problems they are still trying to solve?

While the core technology of solid-state batteries has been proven in laboratories, several challenges remain before they can be widely adopted in electric vehicles.

*   **Manufacturing at Scale:** The biggest hurdle is developing manufacturing processes that can produce large, defect-free solid-state cells at a high volume and an affordable cost. The solid electrolyte is brittle and can be difficult to work with, making it prone to cracking and other defects during production.
*   **Cost:** The materials and manufacturing processes for solid-state batteries are currently more expensive than those for traditional lithium-ion batteries. Costs are expected to come down with scale and technological advancements, but the initial rollout will likely be in higher-priced premium vehicles.
*   **Durability and Lifespan:** While solid-state batteries promise a longer lifespan than lithium-ion batteries, this needs to be proven in real-world driving conditions. Issues like dendrite formation (lithium metal filaments that can cause short circuits) are still a concern, although less so than in liquid electrolyte batteries.
*   **Performance in Varying Conditions:** The performance of solid-state batteries can be affected by temperature and other environmental factors. Automakers and battery developers are working to ensure that the batteries perform reliably in all conditions, from extreme cold to extreme heat.

In summary, while the first wave of semi-solid-state batteries is already here, the widespread adoption of all-solid-state batteries in mainstream electric vehicles is still several years away. The industry is working to overcome the remaining technical challenges, with a focus on scaling up manufacturing and reducing costs.
