# Announcing Zrb-Flow: The Command Line, Reimagined.

For too long, the command line has been a powerful but static tool. We write scripts, chain commands, and build complex pipelines. But when they break—and they always break—it's on us to manually debug and fix them. Today, that changes.

Introducing **Zrb-Flow**, the AI-native automation engine for your terminal.

Zrb-Flow isn't just another task runner; it's an intelligent partner that understands your goals. Built for developers, DevOps engineers, and power users who live in the terminal, Zrb-Flow seamlessly integrates with your existing workflows, supercharging them with the power of AI.

## Seamless Docker & Kubernetes Integration

Stop wrestling with complex `docker-compose` files and arcane `kubectl` commands. Zrb-Flow offers native, context-aware integration with Docker and Kubernetes. Spin up environments, deploy services, and manage your infrastructure with simple, natural language commands. Zrb-Flow's AI understands your intent, translating high-level requests into precise, executable actions.

## The Magic of Self-Healing Pipelines

This is where Zrb-Flow truly shines. Traditional CI/CD pipelines are brittle. A single outdated dependency or a flaky script can bring your entire workflow to a halt.

**Zrb-Flow introduces Self-Healing Pipelines.**

When a script fails, Zrb-Flow doesn't just report the error. It analyzes the output, understands the context, and automatically attempts to fix the underlying issue. Whether it's a syntax error in a shell script or a broken Dockerfile instruction, Zrb-Flow's AI agent proposes a fix, applies it, and re-runs the pipeline—often before you've even had a chance to check the logs.

## Get Started Today

The future of CLI automation is here. It's intelligent, it's resilient, and it's ready to transform your workflow.

**To install Zrb-Flow, simply run:**

```bash
pip install zrb-flow
```
