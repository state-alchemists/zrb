# Solid State Battery Status Report: Late 2024/2025

## Executive Summary

Solid-state batteries (SSBs) represent the next major leap in energy storage technology for electric vehicles and consumer electronics. As of late 2024/2025, the technology has moved beyond laboratory prototypes into road-testing phases, with the first commercial vehicles expected in the 2026-2030 timeframe. However, significant technical and manufacturing challenges remain before widespread adoption becomes economically viable.

## 1. When Are They Actually Hitting the Car Market?

### Semi-Solid-State Batteries (Already on the Road in China)

**China is leading in semi-solid-state battery deployment, with vehicles already available to consumers:**

- **Nio ET7/ET5 (Late 2023):** Already available in China with semi-solid-state batteries from WeLion New Energy Technology. The 150 kWh pack delivers a claimed 648+ mile range. Available through battery swapping rather than direct ownership.

- **IM Motors L6 (2025):** Available with 133 kWh semi-solid-state pack from QingTao Power Technology, offering 620+ miles of range. 900-volt architecture enables adding 248 miles of range in just 12 minutes.

- **MG4 (2025):** First affordable mass-market EV with semi-solid-state batteries, priced between $10,100-$14,400. Uses only 5% liquid electrolyte.

### All-Solid-State Batteries (Testing Phase)

**True all-solid-state batteries are now in road-testing phases:**

- **Mercedes-Benz EQS (Prototype):** At the end of 2024, Mercedes successfully installed a lithium-metal solid-state battery in an EQS and began laboratory testing. Road tests scheduled for the beginning of 2025. The prototype delivers 25% more range (620 miles) than the standard EQS with same battery size.

- **BMW i7 (Prototype):** Testing all-solid-state cells from Solid Power in Munich since summer 2025. Using prismatic cells with sulfide-based solid electrolyte. BMW plans to license technology for pilot production line in Germany.

## 3. What Are the Main Technical Problems Still Being Solved?

### The Five Golden Rule Challenges

According to Bob Galyen, former CTO of CATL, any successful battery technology must meet five criteria. Solid-state batteries fall short on at least three:

1. **Safety** - Promising improvement over liquid electrolyte fires
2. **Performance** - **CHALLENGE**: Performance at temperature, altitude, shock, and vibration
3. **Life** - **CRITICAL CHALLENGE**: No reliable published life cycle numbers
4. **Cost** - **MAJOR BOTTLENECK**: Costs comparable to lithium-ion from a decade ago
5. **Environmental** - Still being validated

### 1. Dendrite Formation and Short Circuits

**The Problem:** Needle-like lithium structures (dendrites) can grow through the solid electrolyte, causing electrical shorts and potential fires.

**Key Issues:**
- Gaps or voids between ceramic electrolyte and lithium allow dendrites to form
- Mechanical properties of solid electrolytes present challenges—brittle and susceptible to cracking under stress
- Stress during cycling leads to loss of contact between electrolyte and cathode
- Cathode fracturing and fatigue can cascade into microcracking, dendrite growth, and electrical shorting

**Current Solutions Being Tested:**
- Avoiding gaps/voids between ceramic and lithium interfaces
- Toyota's silver-carbon composite anode (Samsung SDI also using this approach)
- Tin-carbon layers to suppress dendrites (Solid Power approach)
- Better packaging to allow individual cells to expand during charging
 Hyundai's copper anode layer with protective coating (patented)

### 2. Manufacturing and Production Challenges

**"Production Hell"**

- IEEE Spectrum experts warn solid-state batteries could face the same "production hell" Tesla experienced with Model 3 in 2018
- Building factories takes ~2 years; prototype testing takes 6+ months; real-world validation takes additional time
- Total validation timeline: 7+ years according to Galyen Energy
- "None of these batteries have been validated yet" - Galyen

**Manufacturing Hurdles:**
- Scaling solid electrolyte manufacturing to gigafactory levels
- Manufacturing brittle ceramic/glass materials without defects at automotive scale
- Costs remain above $80/kWh until late 2020s
- High-precision manufacturing required to prevent defects that lead to failures
- Temperature and pressure control during fabrication

### 3. Performance Under Real-World Conditions

**Shock and Vibration**
- Critical concern: "What happens when you're driving down I-75 and you hit a big pit in the road?"
- Solid-state matrix could be damaged by road shocks, potholes, and vibrations
- Brittle electrolytes may fracture under mechanical stress
- This is a major validation hurdle automakers won't overlook

**Temperature Performance**
- Low-temperature performance limitations remain
- Fast charging and reduced cycle life in cold weather require improvement
- However, some breakthroughs: Stellantis/Factorial batteries work from -22°F to 113°F
- Donut Labs claims 99% range retention at -30°C and over 100°C

**Altitude Effects**
- Pressure variations at altitude affecting battery chemistry need validation

### 4. Interfacial and Materials Challenges

**Electrolyte-Electrode Contact**
- Loss of contact between solid electrolyte and electrodes occurs during cycling due to volume changes
- Anode expansion during charging creates stress on the solid electrolyte
- Maintaining contact throughout thermal cycling is difficult

**Material Brittleness**
- Solid electrolytes (ceramics, glass) are brittle compared to liquid or gel electrolytes
- This brittleness leads to cracking and failure under mechanical or thermal stress
- Voids and cracks further exacerbate interfacial issues and potentially cause dendrite growth

### 5. Cost and Scale

**Current Economic Reality:**
- "I haven't seen cost numbers that are even close to competing with liquid-state, lithium-ion batteries" - Bob Galyen
- Costs roughly comparable to lithium-ion prices from a decade ago
- High-precision manufacturing and exotic materials drive costs up
- Limited supply chain for advanced materials (lithium metal, specialty ceramics)

**Scale Required:**
- Need gigafactory-scale production to achieve economies of scale
- Current production is pilot-scale or small-scale
- Building this infrastructure requires billions in capital investment
- Timeline: Small-scale 2027, mass production 2030 (CATL timeline as example)

### 6. Supply Chain and Materials

**Cobalt Dependence**
- Current liquid lithium-ion requires cobalt, which is scarce, expensive, and often mined in countries with weak labor laws
- Solid-state chemistries promise to reduce or eliminate cobalt use
- Toyota's sulfur-based batteries could eliminate cobalt entirely
- However, these new chemistries introduce their own supply chain challenges

**Lithium Metal Anodes:**
- Using lithium metal in anode boosts energy density but introduces safety concerns in liquid systems
- Solid-state enables safer use of lithium metal anodes
- But lithium metal is reactive and challenging to work with at scale
