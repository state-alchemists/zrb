# Solid State Battery Status Update: Late 2024/2025

## 1. When are they actually hitting the market (cars)?

While significant progress has been made, widespread market entry of solid-state batteries in cars is still a few years away for most manufacturers, with initial deployments and small-scale production expected in late 2024 and 2025, leading to more substantial adoption by 2027-2030.

*   **Late 2024 / Early 2025:** A lithium-metal solid-state battery was successfully installed in a modified Mercedes-Benz EQS for laboratory testing by the end of 2024, with road tests commencing in early 2025. SAIC Motor (China) also announced deliveries of its first SSB-powered vehicles in September 2024.
*   **Late 2025:** Some production vehicles utilizing solid-state batteries are anticipated to hit the roads, with volume production expected to gradually ramp up throughout 2026 and 2027.
*   **2025 Timeline:** Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi are targeting a 2025 timeline for their solid-state battery initiatives.
*   **2027-2028 (Mass Production):** Toyota anticipates mass production of its solid-state batteries to begin in this timeframe.
*   **2027 (Demonstration) / 2030 (Large-scale Production):** Several battery cell producers and automakers have committed to demonstrating solid-state electric vehicles by 2027, with large-scale production projected for 2030.

## 2. Who are the big companies involved?

Numerous automotive manufacturers and battery developers are heavily invested in solid-state battery technology:

*   **Automakers:** Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Volkswagen (through its investment in QuantumScape), SAIC Motor (China), Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, GAC.
*   **Battery Developers/Partners:** QuantumScape (partnered with Volkswagen), Sumitomo Metal Mining (partnered with Toyota for cathode materials).

## 3. What are the main technical problems they are still trying to solve?

Despite advancements, several key technical challenges remain before solid-state batteries can achieve widespread commercial viability:

*   **Durability and Cycle Life:** Early solid-state designs faced issues with durability, as repeated charging and discharging cycles caused expansion and contraction within the battery cell. This stress can lead to performance degradation over time.
*   **Mass Production Challenges:** Scaling up from laboratory prototypes to cost-effective, high-volume manufacturing remains a significant hurdle. This includes developing efficient and reliable production processes for solid electrolytes and cell assembly.
*   **Interface Stability:** Ensuring a stable and low-resistance interface between the solid electrolyte and the electrodes is crucial for efficient ion transport and overall battery performance.
*   **Cost:** The current manufacturing processes and materials for solid-state batteries are generally more expensive than those for traditional lithium-ion batteries, which needs to be addressed for competitive pricing in the EV market.
