# Solid State Battery Status Update (Late 2024 / 2025)

## 1. When are they actually hitting the market (cars)?

The widespread market availability of solid-state batteries in cars is generally anticipated in the **2027-2030 timeframe**, though initial deployments and pilot programs are expected sooner.

*   **Late 2024 / Early 2025:** Mercedes-Benz has begun laboratory testing of an EQS equipped with a lithium-metal solid-state battery, with road tests planned for early 2025.
*   **Late 2025:** Some industry observers predict the first production vehicles with solid-state batteries could hit the roads, with volume production increasing through 2026 and 2027.
*   **2025 (Pilot Production):** Nissan is establishing a pilot factory with plans to produce its first batch of solid-state batteries.
*   **2027-2028 (Mass Production):** Toyota aims for mass production of solid-state batteries in this period.
*   **2027-2030 (China):** A Chinese expert estimates that solid-state batteries will be installed in EVs from 2027 in China, with mass production around 2030.

## 2. Who are the big companies involved?

Several major automakers and battery developers are heavily invested in solid-state battery technology:

*   **Automakers:**
    *   **Mercedes-Benz:** Actively testing solid-state batteries in its EQS model.
    *   **Toyota:** A long-time leader in solid-state battery research, aiming for mass production by 2027-2028, and partnering with Sumimoto Metal Mining for cathode materials.
    *   **Nissan:** Building a pilot factory for solid-state battery production by 2025, with commercialization targets for 2029.
    *   **Volkswagen:** Partnered with QuantumScape.
    *   **GAC & SAIC:** Chinese automakers who have unveiled solid-state battery production lines.
*   **Battery Developers/Suppliers:**
    *   **QuantumScape:** A prominent solid-state battery developer, partnered with Volkswagen.
    *   **TDK:** Achieved a significant milestone in solid-state battery material development with high energy density.

    *   **China All-Solid-State Battery Collaborative Innovation Platform (CASIP):** Established to create a supply chain for solid-state batteries by 2030.

## 3. What are the main technical problems they are still trying to solve?

Despite significant advancements, several key technical hurdles need to be overcome for widespread commercialization:

*   **Interfacial Resistance:** Ensuring low resistance at the interface between the solid electrolyte and electrodes is critical for efficient ion transfer and battery performance.
*   **Manufacturing Scalability and Cost Reduction:** Developing cost-effective and large-scale manufacturing processes remains a significant challenge. Current production methods are expensive and not yet suitable for mass market volumes.
*   **Dendrite Formation:** When using lithium-metal anodes, the growth of lithium dendrites (filament-like structures) can lead to short circuits and reduced battery life. Preventing this phenomenon is crucial.
*   **Battery Cycling Performance:** Achieving long cycle life and consistent performance, especially at high charge and discharge rates, is still an area of active research.
*   **Solid-Solid Interface Issues:** In certain types of solid-state batteries, particularly sulfide-based ones, managing the contact and stability of solid interfaces is complex, though progress is being made in reducing required interface pressure.
*   **Cell Pressure Management:** Maintaining optimal internal pressure within the battery cells is important for longevity and safety.
