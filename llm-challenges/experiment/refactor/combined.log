Can you clean this up? I want it to be more modular (maybe use that ETL thing people talk about). Also, use environment variables for config so we can stop hardcoding passwords. 

Bonus points if you add types and make it look like a professional wrote it. Don't break the `report.html` output, our boss uses that." --model "" --session "" --yolo true --attach "" --interactive false[0m
