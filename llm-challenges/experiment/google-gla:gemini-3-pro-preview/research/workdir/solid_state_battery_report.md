# Solid State Battery Status Update: Late 2024 / 2025

**Date:** February 2026
**Status:** Transitioning from "Lab Research" to "Road Testing" & "Demonstration Fleets".

## 1. When are they hitting the market (Cars)?

While headlines often promise "immediate" revolution, the reality for late 2024 and 2025 is that solid-state batteries (SSBs) are appearing in **test mules and limited demonstration fleets**, not yet in mass-production vehicles available at dealerships.

*   **Late 2024 / Early 2025 (Current Status):**
    *   **Mercedes-Benz:** Began road testing a modified **EQS** equipped with solid-state batteries (co-developed with Factorial Energy) in late 2024.
    *   **BMW:** Launched road tests of a **BMW i7** prototype fitted with Solid Power's solid-state cells.
    *   **SAIC & GAC:** Chinese manufacturers have revealed production lines, with some claiming "near-production" readiness earlier than Western counterparts.
*   **2026 (Demonstration Phase):**
    *   **Dodge (Stellantis):** Plans to launch a demonstration fleet of **Dodge Charger Daytona EVs** using Factorial’s FEST solid-state technology.
*   **2027-2028 (Projected Mass Production):**
    *   **Toyota:** Widely cited target for mass production is 2027–2028, with initial rollout likely in hybrids or premium luxury EVs.
    *   **Samsung SDI:** Confirmed plans to begin mass production in 2027.
    *   **Nissan:** Targeting fiscal year 2028 for launch.

**Verdict:** If you are looking to buy a solid-state EV in 2025, you are too early. Expect to see them in the hands of engineers and potentially in limited lease programs (demo fleets) by 2026.

## 2. The Big Companies Involved

The industry is defined by high-profile partnerships between legacy automakers and specialized battery startups.

### Top Partnerships
*   **Mercedes-Benz & Stellantis + Factorial Energy:**
    *   Factorial's "Solstice" battery promises ~600+ miles of range and 40% weight reduction.
*   **Volkswagen + QuantumScape:**
    *   Long-standing partnership. Interestingly, reports in late 2025 suggest their first commercial application might be a **Ducati motorcycle** rather than a car, likely to test the tech in a lower-volume, high-performance vehicle.
*   **BMW + Solid Power:**
    *   BMW has licensed the design and manufacturing process to produce cells at their own pilot lines in Germany.
*   **Toyota + Idemitsu Kosan:**
    *   Focused on sulfide solid electrolytes, aiming for a supply chain capable of mass production by 2027-28.

### Key Battery Manufacturers
*   **Samsung SDI:** Aggressive timeline for 2027 mass production.
*   **CATL:** The dominant player in Li-Ion is also heavily investing in SSBs, though they have historically been skeptical of the "immediate" hype, focusing on semi-solid solutions first.
*   **LG Energy Solution:** Investing heavily in R&D with a dedicated Future Technology Center.

## 3. Main Technical Problems (The "Final Boss" Hurdles)

Despite the road tests, several "hard physics" problems remain the primary bottleneck for scaling from 1 car to 1 million cars.

### A. Dendrite Formation (The Safety Killer)
*   **The Issue:** "Needle-like" growths of lithium metal that form during charging. They can pierce the solid electrolyte separator, causing internal short circuits and fires.
*   **2025 Solutions:** Researchers are experimenting with "thermal stress" (heating/cooling specific sides of the battery) and mechanical pressure to suppress growth, but a fail-safe, mass-manufacturable solution is still being refined.

### B. Manufacturing Scalability (The Cost Killer)
*   **The Issue:** Making a solid-state battery in a clean room is easy; making millions on a gigafactory assembly line is incredibly hard. Solid electrolytes are often brittle (ceramics) or hard to process.
*   **Cost Gap:** Current Li-ion costs are ~$80-$100/kWh. Solid-state cells currently cost significantly more due to low yields and slow manufacturing speeds. Parity is not expected until the late 2020s.

### C. Interface Resistance
*   **The Issue:** Keeping the solid electrolyte in perfect contact with the electrodes (anode/cathode) is difficult. As the battery charges/discharges, the materials expand and contract ("breathing").
*   **Result:** This movement creates gaps (voids) at the interface, leading to high resistance and rapid loss of battery capacity over time.

### D. Mechanical Failure
*   **The Issue:** The solid materials are prone to cracking under the physical stress of expansion/contraction cycles, unlike liquid electrolytes which naturally fill any voids.
