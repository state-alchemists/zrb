# Introducing Zrb-Flow: The Self-Healing CLI Revolution 🚀

**Tired of babysitting your terminal? Meet the AI that fixes your pipelines while you sleep.**

We are thrilled to announce the immediate availability of **Zrb-Flow**, the next-generation automation engine designed exclusively for the CLI power user. 

If you live in the terminal, you know the pain: a missing semicolon in a bash script, a Docker container that refuses to bind, or a Kubernetes pod stuck in `CrashLoopBackOff`. 

**Zrb-Flow changes the game.**

## Why Zrb-Flow?

We didn't just build another task runner. We built an intelligent orchestrator that understands your infrastructure.

### 🧠 True AI Automation
Forget static scripts. Zrb-Flow analyzes your intent and executes complex workflows across your entire stack. It doesn't just run commands; it understands them.

### 🐳 Native Docker & K8s Integration
Zrb-Flow treats containers and clusters as first-class citizens. Spin up test environments, deploy to production, or inspect logs without ever leaving your flow. It hooks directly into the Docker daemon and Kubernetes API for seamless orchestration.

### ✨ The Killer Feature: Self-Healing Pipelines
This is what you've been waiting for. When a script fails, Zrb-Flow doesn't just error out—it **debugs**. 

Using advanced LLM integration, Zrb-Flow analyzes the error output, patches the broken script on the fly, and retries the operation. It’s like having a senior DevOps engineer pair-programming with you 24/7.
