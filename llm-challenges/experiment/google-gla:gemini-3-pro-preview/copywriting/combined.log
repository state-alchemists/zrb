     We are thrilled to announce the launch of **Zrb-Flow**, the next-generation AI automation tool designed specifically for engineers who live in the terminal.
     
     Stop context-switching between your IDE, your cluster dashboard, and ChatGPT. Zrb-Flow brings intelligent orchestration directly to your command line, deeply integrated with the tools you already use.
     
     ## Why Zrb-Flow?
     
     Automation should be robust, not fragile. Zrb-Flow isn't just another task runner; it's an intelligent agent that understands your infrastructure.
     
     ### 🧠 Self-Healing Pipelines
     This is the game-changer. We've all been there: a nightly build fails because of a minor syntax error or a transient dependency issue.
     
     With Zrb-Flow's **Self-Healing Mode**, the system doesn't just crash and send you an email. It captures the error, analyzes the stack trace using advanced LLMs, applies a fix to the script, and **automatically retries**. It fixes broken scripts while you sleep.
     
     ### 🐋 Deep Docker & Kubernetes Integration
     Zrb-Flow doesn't sit on top of your infrastructure; it hooks directly into it.
     *   **Smart Context:** It reads your `Dockerfile` and K8s manifests to understand your architecture.
     *   **Live Debugging:** Pipe logs directly into the AI for instant root-cause analysis on crashing pods.
     *   **Seamless orchestration:** Spin up dev environments that match production parity with a single command.
     
     ### ⚡ Built for the CLI
     No drag-and-drop interfaces. No web wizards. Just pure, unadulterated CLI power. Define workflows in Python or YAML, and control everything from your shell.
     
     ## Get Started
     
     Ready to upgrade your workflow? Zrb-Flow is available today.
