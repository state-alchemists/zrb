## Conclusion

Solid-state battery technology has made significant progress in 2024-2025, transitioning from pure research to early commercialization. While the "holy grail" of all-solid-state batteries remains 2-3 years away from mass production, semi-solid-state batteries are already hitting the market in China. The key challenges of interface stability, dendrite suppression, manufacturing scalability, and cost reduction are being actively addressed by a global ecosystem of automakers, battery companies, and material suppliers.

The 2027-2028 timeframe appears credible for the first mass-market all-solid-state EVs, led by Japanese automakers. However, widespread adoption will depend on solving persistent manufacturing challenges and achieving cost parity with conventional lithium-ion batteries, which continue to improve. The transition to solid-state will likely be gradual, starting with premium vehicles before trickling down to mass-market segments.
