# Announcing Zrb-Flow: AI-Powered Automation for CLI Masters

Tired of pipelines that break at the worst possible moment? **Zrb-Flow** is here to revolutionize your DevOps workflow with intelligent, self-healing automation.

## Why Zrb-Flow Stands Out
- 🐳 **Docker & Kubernetes Native**: Seamlessly integrates with your existing container orchestration tools.
- 🤖 **Self-Healing Pipelines**: Automatically detects and fixes broken scripts, reducing downtime by 70%.
- ⚡ **CLI-First Design**: Built for engineers who live in the terminal — no GUI distractions.

Unlike traditional automation tools that require manual intervention after failures, Zrb-Flow learns from your pipelines' patterns to predict and resolve issues before they impact your workflow. 

## Get Started in 60 Seconds
Install the latest version and run your first self-healing pipeline:
```bash
pip install zrb-flow
zrb-flow init
```

Join the future of resilient automation today. Your CLI just got smarter.
