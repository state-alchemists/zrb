# Announcing Zrb-Flow: Where AI Meets Your CLI

Stop wrestling with broken pipelines. Zrb-Flow transforms your CLI experience with **intelligent automation** that understands Docker, Kubernetes, and your workflow - not just as commands, but as living systems.

## Why CLI Engineers Love It

### 🩹 Self-Healing Pipelines
When your `kubectl apply` fails with cryptic errors or Docker builds crash mid-process, Zrb-Flow doesn’t just report issues - it **diagnoses and patches** them in real-time. Misspelled image tags? YAML indentation errors? The AI analyzes your manifests and fixes them before your pipeline even notices.

### 🐳 Container Intelligence
Seamlessly integrates with your Docker/Kubernetes stack:
```bash
# Example workflow
zrb flow run deployment --cluster=prod
# Auto-detects issues like:
# - Incompatible image tags
# - Resource limit violations
# - Missing service accounts
```

### ⚡ Terminal-First Design
Built *for* your terminal, not against it. No new UI to learn - just enhanced `zrb` commands that work with your existing aliases and shell customizations.

## Ready for the Future of DevOps?

Install today and let your pipelines run themselves:
```bash
pip install zrb-flow
zrb flow init
```

**No more 3AM debugging sessions.** Your infrastructure just got an AI co-pilot that speaks kubectl as fluently as you do.
