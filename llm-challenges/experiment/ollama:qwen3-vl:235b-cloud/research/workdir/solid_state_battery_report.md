# Solid-State Battery Market Status Report (Late 2024/2025)

## 1. Market Entry Timeline

- **2024-2025**: Prototype testing phase with multiple automakers
  - Mercedes-Benz conducted lab testing of EQS equipped with Factorial's semi-solid-state batteries in late 2024, with road tests scheduled to begin in early 2025
  - BMW began testing i7 prototypes with Solid Power's all-solid-state cells in Munich during summer 2025
  - Volkswagen/QuantumScape unveiled all-solid-state battery in Ducati V21L race bike prototype at IAA Mobility 2025

- **2026**: First limited commercial deployments expected
  - Dongfeng Motor Corporation plans commercial production of semi-solid-state batteries for E70 sedans
  - Verge Motorcycles announced first production motorcycle with Donut Labs' all-solid-state batteries (Q1 2026)

- **2027-2030**: Broader market availability
  - Factorial Energy targets mass production by end of decade
  - Toyota expects first commercial solid-state batteries in 2027-2028

*Note: Full solid-state batteries (not semi-solid-state variants) remain limited to prototypes with mass production delayed by manufacturing challenges.*

## 2. Key Companies Involved

| Company | Partner | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **QuantumScape** | Volkswagen | Developed prototype battery for Ducati; PowerCo (VW's battery unit) invested $260M |
| **Factorial Energy** | Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis | Semi-solid-state batteries in EQS prototype; 375 Wh/kg energy density |
| **Solid Power** | BMW | Testing all-solid-state cells in i7; 390 Wh/kg energy density |
| **SAIC Motor** | IM Motors, MG | Semi-solid-state deployed in L6 sedan and MG4 EV |
| **Nio** | WeLion | 150 kWh semi-solid-state packs available via battery swapping in China |
| **Toyota** | Sumitomo Metal Mining | Joint development agreement for cathodes; target 2027-2028 |
| **Dongfeng** | Ganfeng Lithium | 82 kWh semi-solid-state in Voyah Passion; commercial production planned for 2026 |
| **Honda** | — | Developing in-house; testing pilot production line in Japan |

## 3. Remaining Technical Challenges

- **Manufacturing at scale**: Current production limited by defects in solid-electrolyte layers
- **Material limitations**: Semi-solid-state (gel-based) solutions dominate current deployment; true all-solid-state requires breakthroughs
- **Energy density vs. cost trade-offs**: Achieving >400 Wh/kg consistently while controlling costs
- **Production scalability**: Only 10% of global EV demand expected to use solid-state batteries by 2035 (BloombergNEF)
- **Material supply**: Cobalt-free alternatives (e.g., Nissan's sulfur-based electrolyte) still in development
- **Charging infrastructure**: Required to support ultra-fast charging capabilities of new battery chemistries

*Key Insight: Semi-solid-state batteries (with gel electrolytes) have reached limited commercial production, while true all-solid-state batteries remain in prototype phase with mass production timelines consistently delayed by 1-3 years.*
