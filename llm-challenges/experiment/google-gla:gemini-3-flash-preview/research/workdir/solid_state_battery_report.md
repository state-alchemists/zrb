# Solid-State Battery Status Report (Late 2024/2025)

## Executive Summary
As of late 2024 and throughout 2025, solid-state battery (SSB) technology has transitioned from laboratory curiosity to active road testing and early-stage commercialization. While "semi-solid-state" batteries are already hitting the market in China (NIO, IM Motors), fully solid-state versions are currently in the prototype vehicle phase for major Western and Japanese automakers, with mass production targets set for 2027–2028.

## 1. Market Entry Timeline (Cars)

The deployment of solid-state technology is occurring in three distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Semi-Solid-State (2024 – Present)
*   **NIO (China):** Launched a **150 kWh semi-solid-state battery** in early 2024. These packs are currently available to customers via NIO’s battery-swapping network as a rental option for long-distance travel.
*   **SAIC / IM Motors (China):** The **IM Motors L6** launched in mid-2024 featuring a "Lightyear" semi-solid-state battery with a 900V system, capable of adding 400km of range in just 12 minutes of charging.

### Phase 2: Prototype Road Testing (2025)
*   **Mercedes-Benz:** In February 2025, Mercedes integrated a lithium-metal SSB into a production **EQS platform**. Road testing began in early 2025, showing a **25% range increase** (approx. 620 miles).
*   **BMW:** Started road testing an **i7 test mule** equipped with all-solid-state cells (ASSB) in early 2025, focused on temperature control and expansion management.
*   **Stellantis:** Confirmed the rollout of demonstration vehicles (Dodge Charger Daytona) using SSB technology throughout 2025.

### Phase 3: Mass Production (2027 – 2030)
*   **SAIC Motor:** Targetting 2027 for mass delivery of full solid-state batteries.
*   **Toyota:** Aiming for **2027–2028** for mass production, promising a 10-minute charge time and a 20% increase in cruising range.
*   **Nissan:** Targetting **2028** for its first SSB-equipped production model.
*   **Mainstream Adoption:** Broad market availability is not expected until **2030+**, with initial applications limited to high-end performance and luxury vehicles.

## 2. Key Companies Involved

### Automakers (OEMs)
*   **Toyota:** The industry leader in SSB patents; focused on sulfide-based electrolytes.
*   **SAIC Motor (IM Motors):** Leading the charge in immediate commercialization through partnerships with QingTao Energy.
*   **NIO:** First to offer consumer-ready semi-solid-state packs via a swap model.
*   **Mercedes-Benz, BMW, & Stellantis:** Actively road-testing cells from Western startups.
*   **Hyundai/Kia:** Recently patented a cost-effective copper-anode SSB design to reduce manufacturing hurdles.

### Battery Specialists
*   **QuantumScape (Partnered with VW):** Shipped "B-samples" in late 2024 with energy densities of 800 Wh/L.
*   **Factorial Energy (Partnered with Mercedes, Stellantis, Hyundai):** Providing the 375 Wh/kg cells used in current Mercedes road tests.
*   **Solid Power (Partnered with BMW, Ford):** Focused on sulfide electrolytes that can be manufactured using existing lithium-ion equipment.
*   **QingTao Energy & WeLion:** The primary suppliers for the current wave of Chinese semi-solid-state vehicles.

## 3. Main Technical Problems Being Solved

Despite the progress, four critical hurdles remain the focus of engineering teams in 2025:

### A. Dendrite Growth
Lithium "dendrites" (needle-like structures) can still form during fast charging, potentially piercing the solid electrolyte and causing short circuits. Startups like QuantumScape claim to have solved this with proprietary ceramic separators, but long-term durability in real-world conditions is still being validated.

### B. Interface Resistance
Ensuring a perfect, consistent contact between the solid electrolyte and the solid electrodes (solid-solid interface) is difficult.
*   **2025 Breakthrough:** Several manufacturers successfully reduced the required "stack pressure" from the megapascal (MPa) level to kilopascals (kPa), making the batteries easier to package in a car without heavy external bracing.

### C. Manufacturing Scalability & Cost
Current SSB production remains expensive and slow.
*   **Equipment Gap:** Fully solid-state batteries often require different manufacturing environments (e.g., moisture-free "dry rooms" for sulfides).
*   **Yield Rates:** Achieving the same 90%+ yield rates as traditional lithium-ion is a multi-year challenge currently in the "pilot line" phase.

### D. Mechanical Stability (Volume Expansion)
Electrodes expand and contract during charge cycles. In a liquid battery, the fluid absorbs this movement. In a solid battery, this can cause **cracks and voids**, leading to a rapid loss of capacity. Recent work focuses on "composite" electrolytes that have some flexibility to handle this stress.
