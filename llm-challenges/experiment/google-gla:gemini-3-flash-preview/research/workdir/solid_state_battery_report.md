# Solid-State Battery Status Report (Late 2024 / 2025)

## 1. Market Entry Timeline: When are they hitting the road?

The transition to solid-state batteries (SSBs) is happening in two distinct phases: **Semi-Solid State** (available now) and **All-Solid-State** (coming later this decade).

*   **2024 (Current Status):**
    *   **Semi-Solid Arrival:** "Semi-solid" batteries (using a hybrid liquid/solid electrolyte) are already in production. In **May 2024**, IM Motors (China) launched the **L6** sedan featuring a 130kWh semi-solid battery. **Nio** also began rolling out its 150kWh semi-solid battery pack for its swap stations in mid-2024.
    *   **Validation Milestones:** In **October 2024**, **QuantumScape** began shipping its "B-sample" cells (QSE-5) to automotive partners for vehicle-level testing—a critical step before mass production.
*   **2025 (Near Future):**
    *   **Pilot Series:** Several manufacturers, including **Changan** and **GAC**, have announced plans to begin small-scale "pilot" production of all-solid-state batteries in vehicles by late 2025.
    *   **Luxury Tier:** Expect to see limited-edition, ultra-high-end EVs featuring early SSB technology as a "proof of concept" in the 2025-2026 window.
*   **2027–2030 (Mass Market):**
    *   **Toyota & Samsung SDI:** Both giants have pegged **2027–2028** as their target for "mass production" of all-solid-state batteries.
    *   **Mainstream Adoption:** Industry analysts expect SSBs to become a common option for mainstream premium EVs only by **2030**.

## 2. Big Companies Involved

The race is divided between legacy automakers, battery giants, and specialized startups:

*   **Automotive Manufacturers:**
    *   **Toyota:** Holds the most patents globally and is partnered with **Idemitsu Kosan** for sulfide electrolyte production.
    *   **VW Group (PowerCo):** Heavily invested in QuantumScape; they recently signed a deal to scale up production.
    *   **SAIC / IM Motors:** Currently leading in actual vehicle deployment (semi-solid).
    *   **Mercedes-Benz & BMW:** Partnered with **Factorial Energy** and **Solid Power** respectively, with BMW currently running a demo fleet of test vehicles.
*   **Battery Specialists & Startups:**
    *   **QuantumScape (USA):** Focused on "anode-free" lithium-metal technology.
    *   **Samsung SDI (South Korea):** Launched a dedicated SSB pilot line in 2023 and is targeting the high-end luxury market.
    *   **CATL (China):** The world’s largest battery maker, currently leading the "China All-Solid-State Battery Collaborative Innovation Platform" (CASIP).
    *   **ProLogium (Taiwan):** Opened the world's first giga-scale SSB factory in early 2024.

## 3. Main Technical Problems Being Solved

Despite the hype, four major engineering "bottlenecks" remain:

1.  **Lithium Dendrites:** Even in solid electrolytes, microscopic "fingers" of lithium (dendrites) can grow through cracks during fast charging, causing the battery to short-circuit and fail.
2.  **Interfacial Resistance:** Unlike liquid electrolytes that "wet" every surface, solid electrolytes have trouble maintaining perfect contact with the electrodes. If the layers pull apart slightly, the battery stops working.
3.  **Volume Expansion:** Lithium-metal anodes expand and contract significantly during charge cycles. This mechanical stress can crack the brittle solid electrolyte, requiring complex (and heavy) pressure systems to keep the battery together.
4.  **Manufacturing Scalability & Cost:** Producing SSBs currently requires expensive vacuum environments and moisture-free "dry rooms" (especially for sulfide-based electrolytes). As of late 2024, an SSB pack is estimated to cost **3x to 5x more** than a standard liquid lithium-ion pack.
