  🧠 The issue was a race condition in the `Inventory.purchase` method. Multiple[0m[2m concurrent requests were checking the stock levels before any of them had decremented it, leading to over-selling and negative stock.[0m[2m
     
     I have fixed this by introducing an `asyncio.Lock` to ensure that the "check and decrement" operation[0m[2m is atomic.
     
     ### Changes:
     - Added `self.lock = asyncio.Lock()` to the `Inventory[0m[2m` class constructor.
