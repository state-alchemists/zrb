Your goal is to create an actionable items to update Zrb's default prompt components based on competitor's code.

Currently you are on zrb project directory. We have competitor's code:
- gemini-cli at ~/gemini-cli
- opencode at ~/opencode.

Put all your analysis under ~/zrb/analysis folder.

First you need to understand how Zrb prompt system works in detail, put your study under ~/zrb/analysis/zrb.md.

Then you also make comparison study to both gemini-cli and opencode (put them into files)

And finally, you make list of actionable items (also put it into file).
