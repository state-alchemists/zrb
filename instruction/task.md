Look at how `zrb_ask` and `zrb_chat` actually work, how the system/user prompt is constructed and how the tool calling mechanism works.
Put your finding on `./finding.md`.

See why `write_to_file` sometimes failed. The sample of tool-call is provided at `./tool-call.log`.

Suggest improvement, write on `plan.md`
