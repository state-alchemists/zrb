## 2.10.0 (March 12, 2026)

- **Feature: Grep Timeout Parameter**:
  - Added `timeout` parameter to `Grep` tool in `src/zrb/llm/tool/file.py`, allowing users to set a maximum execution time for search operations. This prevents long-running regex searches from blocking the agent indefinitely.

- **Feature: Parallel Agent Delegation**:
  - Enhanced `DelegateToAgent` tool in `src/zrb/llm/tool/delegate.py` to support parallel execution of multiple sub-agents, significantly improving performance for batch processing workflows.
  - Added `tool_factories` and `toolset_factories` support to `LLMTask`, enabling dynamic tool resolution at execution time.
  - Updated SubAgent system prompts and improved context handling for delegated tasks.

- **Refactor: Replace python-jose with PyJWT**:
  - Migrated JWT handling from `python-jose` to `PyJWT` in `src/zrb/runner/web_util/token.py` and `src/zrb/runner/web_util/user.py`.
  - PyJWT is a more focused, actively maintained library specifically for JWT operations.
  - Updated `pyproject.toml` dependency from `python-jose[cryptography]` to `PyJWT ^2.8.0`.

- **Refactor: Reduce Cyclomatic Complexity in Hook Matcher**:
  - Refactored `_evaluate_matchers` in `src/zrb/llm/hook/manager.py` from a 23-branch if/elif chain to a clean dispatch dictionary pattern.
  - Each matcher operator (EQUALS, NOT_EQUALS, CONTAINS, STARTS_WITH, ENDS_WITH, REGEX, GLOB) now has its own focused module-level function.
  - Improved maintainability: Adding new operators now simply requires extending the `_MATCHER_OPERATORS` dictionary.

- **Maintenance: Code Formatting and Test Coverage**:
  - Applied consistent code formatting across multiple files.
  - Added extensive test coverage for callbacks, commands, input handling, LLM agents, and delegate tools.
