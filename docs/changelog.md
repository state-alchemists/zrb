## 2.0.2

- **Improvement: Enhanced Skill Management**:
  - **Depth-Controlled Scanning**: Added `max_depth` parameter to `SkillManager` to control recursive directory scanning depth, improving performance for large projects.
  - **Customizable Ignore Patterns**: Introduced `ignore_dirs` parameter allowing users to customize which directories to skip during skill discovery.
  - **Refined Directory Ignore List**: Updated default ignore patterns to be more focused on build artifacts and less on IDE-specific directories.
  - **Improved Error Handling**: Added robust try-catch blocks to gracefully handle permission errors and inaccessible directories during skill scanning.
- **Code Quality & Maintenance**:
  - **Cleanup**: Removed unused import (`ToolCallHandler`) from `llm_chat_task.py` to reduce code clutter.
  - **Naming Consistency**: Refactored `IGNORE_DIRS` constant to `_IGNORE_DIRS` following Python convention for module-private variables.
- **Testing**:
  - **Comprehensive Depth Testing**: Added thorough unit tests for the new `max_depth` functionality, ensuring skill discovery respects depth limits.
  - **Edge Case Coverage**: Enhanced test suite to validate skill manager behavior with deeply nested directory structures.

## 2.0.1

- **Feature: Enhanced LLM Interaction**:
  - **Slash Commands for Skills**: Automatically converted user-invocable Claude skills into executable slash commands (e.g., `/<skill-name>`) within the chat TUI.
  - **Dynamic Argument Extraction**: Implemented automatic argument detection and parsing for skill-based slash commands.
  - **Safer Tool Policies**: Improved `auto_approve` tool policy with directory-aware checks, automatically approving read operations only within the current working directory.
- **Improvement: LLM Prompt & Mandate**:
  - **Assertive Mandate**: Updated the core mandate to be more assertive, explicitly requiring the AI to check the provided system context before using discovery tools.
  - **Streamlined System Context**: Flattened the system context structure to remove redundant headers and improve token efficiency.
  - **Anti-Hallucination Measures**: Added explicit instructions to prevent the AI from defaulting to "You are absolutely right" and instead focus on reasoned explanations.
- **Documentation**:
  - **New Guide**: Added [Customizing the AI Assistant](./advanced-topics/customizing-ai-assistant.md) guide.
  - **Updated Docs**: Comprehensive updates to task type documentation, configuration guides, and architectural overviews to match the 2.0 architecture.
- **Bug Fixes & Refinement**:
  - Fixed argument residue handling in custom chat commands.
  - Improved autocompletion metadata for custom commands in the TUI.
  - Refined skill management to distinguish between model-invocable and user-invocable skills.

## 2.0.0

- **Refactor: Major Architectural Overhaul**:
  - **LLM Module Consolidation**: Moved all LLM-related logic from `src/zrb/builtin/llm` and `src/zrb/task/llm` to a unified `src/zrb/llm` package for better modularity and maintainability.
  - **Tool Relocation**: LLM tools (e.g., `analyze_repo`, `write_to_file`) are now located in `zrb.llm.tool`.
  - **Centralized Configuration**: Merged multiple LLM-specific and project-wide configuration files into a robust, centralized `Config` class in `src/zrb/config/config.py`.
- **Feature: Enhanced LLM Interface**:
  - **Interactive TUI**: Introduced a new, feature-rich Terminal User Interface (TUI) for `llm-chat`, providing a more responsive and visually appealing experience with syntax highlighting and custom layouts.
  - **Improved Command Structure**: Consolidated and refined LLM-related commands (e.g., `/save`, `/load`, `/attach`, `/exec`) for better usability.
  - **ASCII Art & Banners**: Added customizable ASCII art and banners for the CLI and AI assistant.
- **Feature: Prompt & Agent Management**:
  - **Centralized Prompt System**: Introduced a more robust prompt management system with support for markdown-based templates.
  - **Skill Management**: Introduced a new skill management system to extend LLM capabilities dynamically via `SkillManager`.
  - **New Agent Framework**: Re-implemented LLM agents with better history tracking, summarization, and tool-call policies.
- **Feature: LLM Challenge Suite**:
  - **Benchmarking**: Added a comprehensive suite of challenges in `llm-challenges/` for benchmarking AI agent performance in scenarios like bug fixing, refactoring, and copywriting.
- **Performance & Cleanup**:
  - **Code Pruning**: Conducted a significant "prune" of the codebase, removing redundant components, old tests, and unused dependencies to improve startup time and reduce package size.
  - **Lazy Loading**: Further optimized imports to ensure faster CLI responsiveness.
- **Testing**:
  - **Updated Test Suite**: Completely refactored the test suite to align with the new architecture, ensuring high coverage and stability for the 2.0 release.
