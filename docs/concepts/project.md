Zrb allows you to isolate your work by putting them into multiple Zrb projects.

At its core, a project is any directory containing a single file named `zrb_init.py`. This simple setup is already sufficient for a simple hello-world project.

However, to make something more than a simple hello-world, you better use `zrb project create` command.

```bash
zrb project create --project-dir my-project --project-name my-project
```

Once invoked, you will see a project named `my-project` under your current directory. Let's see what this project looks like:

```bash
cd my-project
ls -al
```

Every Zrb project has a file named `zrb_init.py` under the top-level directory. This file is your entry point to define your Task definitions.

By convention, a project usually contains two other sub-directories:

- ___automate__: This folder contains all your automation scripts and task definitions
- __src__: This folder contains all your resources like Docker compose file, helm charts, and source code.

Moreover, Zrb provides some built-in Tasks under `project` Task Group. As always, you can invoke `zrb project` to see those tasks.

# Using `project.sh`

When you create a project using `zrb project create` command, you will find a file named `project.sh`. This script file helps you to load the virtual environment, install requirements, and activate shell completion.

To use the script, you need to invoke the following command:

```bash
source project.sh
```

Anytime you start working on your project, you should load `project.sh`.
