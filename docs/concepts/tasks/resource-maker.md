# ResourceMaker

ResourceMaker helps you create text resources, whether they are code or licenses.

For example, let's say you have the following template under `mit-license-template/license`

```
Copyright (c) <zrb_year> <zrb_copyright_holders>

```

You want your user to be able to add the license to any app and replacing `<year>` and `<copyright holders>` with user input.

To accomplish this, you can make a resource maker:

```python
from zrb import ResourceMaker, StrInput, runner
import os

CURRENT_DIR = os.path.dirname(__file__)

add_mit_license = ResourceMaker(
    name='add-mit-license',
    inputs=[
        StrInput(name='destination'),
        StrInput(name='year'),
        StrInput(name='copyright-holder')
    ],
    destination_path='{{input.destination}}',
    template_path=os.path.join(CURRENT_DIR, 'mit-license-template'),
    replacements={
        '<zrb_year>': '{{input.year}}',
        '<zrb_copyright_holders>': '{{input.copyright_holder}}',
    }
)

runner.register(add_mit_license)
```

Note that your template folder might contains a very complex structure. For example, you can make your application boiler plate into a template.
