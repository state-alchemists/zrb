# Defining Different Tasks With The Same Name Under The Same Group

```python
from zrb import CmdTask, runner

hello1 = CmdTask(
    name='hello',
    cmd='echo "hello mars"'
)
runner.register(hello1)

hello2 = CmdTask(
    name='hello',
    cmd='echo "hello world"'
)
runner.register(hello2)
```

You can see that `hello1` and `hello2` share the same name. Both of them also has the same `group` (i.e., not defined).

In this case, `hello2` will override `hello1`.

This leads to tricky situation. For example, you believe that `zrb hello` should yield `hello mars`, yet it keep showing `hello world`.

# Detecting the Problem

First of all, detecting the problem will be easier if you use the same convention to define task property:
- Use single quote instead of double quote for string value whenever possible
- Not using space between property name and property value (i.e., `name='hello'`)

Once you do so, you can use `search` feature in your IDE/text editor (e.g., `name='hello'`). Make sure every task name is unique so that they don't accidentally overwrite each other.

# Avoiding the Problem

To avoid the problem completely, you can do:

- Always un `zrb` or `zrb [task-groups]` to see list of registered task name.
- Organize your tak definiton location.
    - Put tasks that has similar context under the same `task-group`.
    - Put those tasks physically close to each other (at the same file of under the same directory).
