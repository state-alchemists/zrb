# `Scheduler`

The `Scheduler` task is your tool for running tasks on a recurring basis. It uses cron-like syntax to trigger other tasks at specific intervals. It's a type of `BaseTrigger`, meaning its job is to kick off other tasks when a certain eventâ€”in this case, a scheduled timeâ€”occurs.

When the schedule matches the current time, the `Scheduler` pushes the current timestamp to an `XCom` queue. A `Callback` task can then listen to this queue and execute its action.

## Example

Let's create a task that runs every minute and prints the time.

```python
from zrb import Scheduler, Task, Callback, StrInput, cli

# 1. The task we want to run on a schedule
print_scheduled_time = cli.add_task(
    Task(
        name="print-scheduled-time",
        description="Prints the time received from the scheduler",
        input=StrInput(name="message"),
        action=lambda ctx: ctx.print(f"Scheduled task triggered at: {ctx.input.message}"),
    )
)

# 2. The Scheduler to trigger the task
minute_scheduler = cli.add_task(
    Scheduler(
        name="minute-scheduler",
        description="Triggers a task every minute",
        schedule="@minutely",  # Or a cron string like "* * * * *"
        queue_name="scheduled_events", # The XCom queue to push to
        
        # 3. The Callback that links the scheduler to the task
        callback=Callback(
            task=print_scheduled_time,
            # Map the data from the XCom queue to the task's input
            input_mapping={"message": "{str(ctx.xcom['scheduled_events'].pop())}"},
        ),
    )
)

# You can even add more callbacks to the same scheduler
log_event_task = cli.add_task(Task(name="log-event", action=lambda ctx: print("Logging event...")))
minute_scheduler.append_callback(Callback(task=log_event_task))
```

**Note**: Schedulers are long-running tasks. You would typically start them in the background to have them continuously check the schedule and trigger their callbacks.

**When to use**: Use `Scheduler` for any recurring job, such as nightly backups, hourly data processing, or daily reports. It's the foundation for automation that runs on a timetable.
