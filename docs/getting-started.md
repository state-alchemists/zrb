# Getting started

Welcome to Zrb's getting started guide.

We will cover all the basic you need to know before working with Zrb. You will learn about:

- [How to run a task](#running-a-task)
- [How to create a project](#creating-a-project)
- How to create a simple task
- How to define upstreams
- How to create a long running task

This guide assume you have some familiarity with CLI and Python.

# Running a task

Once you installed Zrb, you can run some built-in tasks immediately. To run any Zrb task, you need to follow the following pattern:

```bash
zrb [task-groups...] <task-name> [task-parameters...]
```

For example, you want to run `encode` that is located under `base64` group, you can do so by execute the following command:

```bash
zrb base64 encode --text "non-credential-string"
```

```

> __‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:__ Anyone can easily decode a base64-encoded string. Don't use it to encrypt your password or any important credentials.

Related tasks are usually located under the same `task-group`.

For example, you have all base64 related tasks (e.g., `decode` and `encode`) under `base64` task-group.

Let's try to decode our base64-encoded text:

```bash
zrb base64 decode --text "bm9uLWNyZWRlbnRpYWwtc3RyaW5n"
```

You should get your original text back.

> __üí° HINT:__ You don't have to memorize any `task-group` or `task` name. The next two subsections will show you how to locate and execute any `task` without memorize anything.

## Getting available tasks/task groups

To find out what tasks/task-groups are available, you can type `zrb` and press enter.

```bash
zrb
```

```
Usage: zrb [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

# Creating a project

To make things more manageable, you need to put all your resources and task definitions in a `project`.

Suppose you want to create a project under `my-project`, then you can invoke the following command:

```bash
zrb project create --project-dir my-project
```

Once invoked, you will have a directory named `my-project`. You can move to the directory and start to see how a project looks like:

```bash
cd my-project
ls -al
```

```

```

Every Zrb project has a file named `zrb_init.py` on it's top level directory. This file is your entry point to define your task definitions.

It is recommended that you define your tasks under `_automate` directory and import them into your `zrb_init.py`. This will help you manage the [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns).

Aside from `zrb_init.py`, you will also find some other files/directory:

- `.git` and `.gitignore`, indicating that your project is also a git repository.
- `README.md`, your README file.
- `project.sh`, a shell script to initiate your project.
- `requirements.txt`, list of necessary python packages to run start a project. Make sure to update this if you declare a task that depends on other Python library.
- `template.env`, your default environment variables.
- `_automate`, a directory contains task definitions that should be imported in `zrb_init.py`.
- `src`, your project resources (e.g., source code, docker compose file, helm charts, etc)

By default, Zrb will create a default `task-group` named `project`. Try to type:

```bash
zrb project
```

```

# Creating a simple task

Once your project has been created, you can add some new tasks to your project.

Let's say you work for a company named `Arasaka`, and you want to show a cool CLI banner for your company.

```bash
zrb project add cmd-task --project-dir . --task-name show-banner
```

Zrb will automatically do a few things for you:

- Create `_automate/show_banner.py`
- Import `_automate.show_banner` into `zrb_init.py`.

Now you can try to run the task:

```bash
zrb project show-banner
```

```

To run again: zrb project show-banner
show banner
```

Now let's make the banner cooler with `figlet`. You can do so by editing `_automate/show_banner.py`. If you are using VSCode, you can type `code .` in your terminal.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è We will use `figlet`. Try to type `figlet hello` and see whether things work or not. If you are using Ubuntu, you might need to install figlet by invoking `sudo apt install figlet`.

Make sure to modify the `cmd` property of your `show_banner` task, so that it looks like the following:

```python
from zrb import CmdTask, runner
from zrb.builtin._group import project_group

###############################################################################
# Task Definitions
###############################################################################

show_banner = CmdTask(
    name='show-banner',
    description='show banner',
    group=project_group,
    cmd=[
        'figlet Arasaka'
    ]
)
runner.register(show_banner)

```

Cool. You make it. [Saburo Arasaka](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Saburo_Arasaka) will be proud of you üòâ.

# Creating a long-running task

Arasaka is a data-driven (and family-driven) company. They need their data scientists to experiment a lot to present the most valuable information/knowledge.

For this, they need to be able to create a lot of notebooks for experimentation.

To make sure things work, you need to:
- Install jupyterlab.
- Add Jupyterlab to your `requirements.txt`.
- Create a `notebooks` directory under `src`.
- Create a `start-jupyter` task.

Let's start by installing jupyterlab

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

Once jupyterlab has been installed, you need to add it into requirements.txt. You can do so by typing `pip freeze | grep jupyterlab` and add the output to your `requirements.txt`. Or you can do it with a single command:

```bash
pip freeze | grep jupyterlab >> requirements.txt
```

Now let's make a `notebooks` directory under `src`.

```bash
mkdir -p src/notebooks
touch src/notebooks/.gitkeep
```

You need an empty `.gitkeep` file, to tell git to not ignore the directory.

## Adding start-jupyterlab

We have a few requirements for `start-jupyterlab` task

- You should show Arasaka banner before starting jupyterlab.
- `start-jupyterlab` is considered completed only if the port is accessible.
- Arasaka employee can choose the port to serve jupyterlab in their computer.

Let's start by adding the task to your project.

```bash
zrb project add cmd-task --project-dir . --task-name start-jupyterlab
```

Now, let's modify `_automate/start_jupyterlab.py` into the following:

```python
from zrb import CmdTask, runner, IntInput, PortChecker
from zrb.builtin._group import project_group
from _automate.show_banner import show_banner
import os

###############################################################################
# Task Definitions
###############################################################################

notebook_path = os.path.join(
    os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)), 'src', 'notebooks'
)

start_jupyterlab = CmdTask(
    name='start-jupyterlab',
    description='start jupyterlab',
    group=project_group,
    inputs=[
        IntInput(name='jupyterlab-port', default=8080)
    ],
    upstreams=[show_banner],
    cmd='jupyter lab --no-browser --port={{input.jupyterlab_port}} ' +
        f'--notebook-dir="{notebook_path}"',
    checkers=[
        PortChecker(port='{{input.jupyterlab_port}}')
    ]
)
runner.register(start_jupyterlab)

```

First of all, we import `IntInput` and `PortChecker`, so that we can ask the user to choose the port number and check whether jupyterlab has been started on that port.

We also need to import `os`, so that we can determine the location of your `notebook_path`.

Finally we add some properties to `start_jupyterlab`:

- `inputs`: List of user inputs. We add a new input named `jupyterlab-port`. By default, the value will be `8080`.
- `upstreams`: List of tasks that should be completed before the current task is started. We want `show_banner` to be executed here.
- `cmd`: Command to be executed. You can use Jinja templating here. `{{input.jupyterlab_port}}` refers to the value `jupyterlab-port` input.
- `checkers`: List of task to determine whether current task has been completed or not. In this case we want to make sure that the port has already available for requests.

## Starting the jupyterlab

Finally, let's see and make sure things are working:

```
