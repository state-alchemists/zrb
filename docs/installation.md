# Installation Methods

Zrb provides three installation methods to help you get started.

- Installing Zrb using the installation script
- Installing Zrb as a Python package
- Installing Zrb as a docker container

## Installing Zrb Using Installation Script

  <p>
    <sub>
      Installation Script: Get you started in less than 5 minutes
    </sub>
  </p>
</div>

If you are on a new computer or are new to Python, we have an [installation script](https://github.com/state-alchemists/zrb/blob/main/install.sh) that help you install [`Pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and `Zrb`.

To run the installation script, you should open your terminal and type the following command:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/state-alchemists/zrb/main/install.sh | bash
```

We recommend this installation method if you work on a new computer/VM.

## Installing Zrb As A Python Package

If you already have your own Python Ecosystem (i.e., [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest), or Venv), you can install Zrb as a Python package using the Pip command.


### Checking for Prerequisites

Before installing Zrb as a Python package, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- üêç `Python`
- üì¶ `Pip`
- üèùÔ∏è `Venv`

If you are using üêß Ubuntu, the following command should help you install the prerequisites:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv python-is-python3
```

If you are using üçé Mac, the following command will work:

```bash
# Make sure you have homebrew installed, see: https://brew.sh/
brew install python3
ln -s venv/bin/pip3 /usr/local/bin/pip
ln -s venv/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python
```

### Installing The Pip Package

Installing Zrb in your system is as easy as typing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install zrb
```

Like any Python package, you can install Zrb in your [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Installing Zrb in a virtual environment allows you to have many versions of Zrb on the same computer.


## Installing Zrb On Termux

</div>

Termux provides a terminal interface in your Android phone/tablet. It lacks a lot of things like docker, etc. But it is still usable in a lot of cases.

To install Termux on your device, you need to follow [Termux documentation](https://github.com/termux/termux-app#f-droid).

In general, this is what you need to do:

- Install F-droid on your device.
- Install the following applications using F-droid:
  - Termux
  - Termux-notification
  - Termux-api
  - Termux-styling (optional)
- Set Termux repository.

  ```bash
  termux-change-repo
  ```

- Set some environments. Execute the script.

  ```bash
  export CFLAGS="-wno-incompatible-function-pointer-types"
  export GRPC_PYTHON_DISABLE_LIBC_COMPATIBILITY=1
  export GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_SYSTEM_OPENSSL=1 
  export GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_SYSTEM_ZLIB=1 
  export GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_SYSTEM_CARES=1 
  export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -u__android_api__ -d__android_api__=26 -include unistd.h"
  export LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -llog"
  ```

- Install necessary packages.

  ```bash
  pkg install python rust clang cmake build-essential golang git openssh tmux helix curl wget binutils postgresql
  ```

- Create a virtual environment and install Zrb.

  ```bash
  python -m venv ~/.local
  source ~/.local/bin/activate
  ```

- Optionally, you can install `zsh`.

  ```bash
  zrb devtool install zsh
  ```

- Finally, add the script to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, depending on your default shell.

  ```bash
  export CFLAGS="-wno-incompatible-function-pointer-types"
  export GRPC_PYTHON_DISABLE_LIBC_COMPATIBILITY=1
  export GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_SYSTEM_OPENSSL=1 
  export GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_SYSTEM_ZLIB=1 
  export GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_SYSTEM_CARES=1 
  export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -u__android_api__ -d__android_api__=26 -include unistd.h"
  export LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -llog"

  source ~/.local/bin/activate
  ```

- If you like Tmux and Helix Editor, install them using Zrb.

  ```bash
  zrb devtool install helix
  zrb devtool install tmux
  hx --grammar fetch
  hx --grammar build 
  ```

## Installing Zrb As A Docker Container

  <p>
    <sub>
      Docker Container: Always ready for anything.
    </sub>
  </p>
</div>

If you prefer to work with Docker or you don't want to install Python on your computer, you can install Zrb as a Docker container.

The easiest way to get started is by creating a `docker-compose.yml` file as follows:

```yaml
# Filename: docker-compose.yml
version: '3'

x-logging: &default-logging
  options:
    max-size: "100m"
    max-file: "5"
  driver: json-file

services:

  zrb:
    image: ${ZRB_IMAGE:-docker.io/stalchmst/zrb}
    logging: *default-logging
    container_name: zrb
    hostname: zrb
    command: sleep infinity
    volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    - ./project:/project
    ports:
    - 3001:3001 # or/and any other ports you want to expose.
```

Once you create a docker-compose file, you can invoke the following command to start the container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You will be able to run any Zrb tasks by accessing the container's bash:

```bash
docker exec -it zrb bash
```

### Extending Zrb Docker Image

You can extend the Zrb docker image to match your needs better.

To do this, you need to create a `Dockerfile` as follows:

```Dockerfile
# Filename: Dockerfile
FROM docker.io/stalchmst/zrb:latest

# We want to install AWS CLI and numpy in our image
RUN zrb devtool install aws
RUN pip install numpy
```

Then you need to update your `docker-compose.yml`.

```yaml
# Filename: docker-compose.yml
version: '3'

x-logging: &default-logging
  options:
    max-size: "100m"
    max-file: "5"
  driver: json-file

services:

  zrb:
    # We want to use the new extended image instead of the original one.
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      context: .
    logging: *default-logging
    container_name: zrb
    hostname: zrb
    command: sleep infinity
    volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    - ./project:/project
    ports:
    - 3001:3001 # or/and any other ports you want to expose.
```

Finally, you can recreate and run the container:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

Once you installed Zrb, you can install third-party developer tools as needed. Some tools like `docker` and `nvm` are crucial if you want to create and test your application.

You can invoke `zrb devtool install <developer-tool>` to install the tools.

```bash
zrb devtool install
```

```
Usage: zrb devtool install [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Install developer tools

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  aws        AWS CLI
  docker     Most popular containerization platform
  gcloud     Gcloud CLI
  gvm        GVM provides interface to manage go version
  helix      Post modern text editor
  helm       Package manager for kubernetes
  kubectl    Kubernetes CLI tool
  nvm        NVM allows you to quickly install and use different versions...
  pulumi     Universal infrastructure as code
  pyenv      Simple Python version management
  sdkman     SDKMAN! is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple...
  selenium   Selenium + Chrome web driver
  terraform  Open source IAC by Hashicorp
  tmux       Terminal multiplexer
  zsh        Zsh terminal + oh-my-zsh + zdharma
```

For example, you need to work with multiple version of Golang, and you need GVM to manage different version of the compiler. In that case, you can invoke the following command:

```bash
zrb devtool install gvm
```
