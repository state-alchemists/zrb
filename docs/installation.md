# Installation Methods

## Using Installation Script

We provide an [installation script](https://github.com/state-alchemists/zrb/blob/main/install.sh) to help you install `pyenv` and `Zrb`. You can run the installation script as follows:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/state-alchemists/zrb/main/install.sh | bash
```

## As Python Package

### Checking for Prerequisites

Before installing Zrb as Python packages, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- üêç `Python`
- üì¶ `Pip`
- üèùÔ∏è `Venv`

If you are using üêß Ubuntu, the following command should work:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv python-is-python3
```

If you are using üçé Mac, the following command will work:

```bash
# Make sure you have homebrew installed, see: https://brew.sh/
brew install python3
ln -s venv/bin/pip3 /usr/local/bin/pip
ln -s venv/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python
```

If you prefer Python distribution like [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), that might work as well.

### Installing The Pip Package

Installing Zrb in your system is as easy as typing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install zrb
```

Like any Python package, you can install Zrb in your [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Installing Zrb in a virtual environment allows you to have many versions of Zrb on the same computer.


## As Docker Container

If you prefer to work with Docker, you can create a `docker-compose.yml` file as follows:

```yaml
version: '3'

x-logging: &default-logging
  options:
    max-size: "100m"
    max-file: "5"
  driver: json-file

networks:
  zrb:
    name: zrb
    external: true

services:

  zrb:
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      context: .
      args:
        ZRB_VERSION: ${ZRB_VERSION:-latest}
    image: ${ZRB_IMAGE:-docker.io/stalchmst/zrb}
    logging: *default-logging
    container_name: zrb
    hostname: zrb
    command: sleep infinity
    volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    - ./project:/project
    ports:
    - 3001:3001 # or/and any other ports you want to expose.
    networks:
    - zrb
```

Once you create a docker-compose file, you can invoke the following command to start the container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You will be able to run any Zrb tasks by accessing the container's bash:

```bash
docker exec -it zrb bash
```

# Post Installation

Once Zrb has been installed, you can install third-party developer tools as needed. Some tools like `docker` and `nvm` are crucial if you want to create and test your application.

You can invoke `zrb devtool install <developer-tool>` to install the tools.

```bash
zrb devtool install
```

```
