# Preparing Your Machine

> This guide has been tested under `debian 12` and `ubuntu 22.0.4`

Before working with Zrb, you must ensure you have Zrb installed on your system.

If you are working on a new computer, the following command will help you install Zrb and Pyenv:

```bash
# On a new computer
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/state-alchemists/zrb/main/install.sh | bash
```

If you already have your own Python Ecosystem (i.e., [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest), or Venv), you can install Zrb using the Pip command.

```bash
# On a computer with its own Python ecosystem.
pip install zrb
```

Alternatively, you can also install Zrb as a container. Please see the [installation guide](./installation.md) for more detailed instructions.


# Install Essential Packages for Ubuntu/Debian

Next you can install essential packages for development.

```bash
zrb ubuntu install essentials
```

# Setup Zsh

Zsh and `oh-my-zsh` is highly compatible with `bash`.
Installing zsh is not mandatory but highly recommended.

To setup and load Zsh, you need to run the following command:

```bash
zrb devtool install zsh
```

The command will help you to setup
- Zsh
- Oh-my-zsh
- Zinit
- Zdharma (will be installed once you reload the terminal)

To load the terminal, you need to `exit` from your current session and re-login.

```bash
exit
```

# Setup Tmux

Tmux is terminal multiplexer. It is useful and highly recommended if you need to spawn multiple terminals in a single panel.

To install tmux, you need to invoke the following command:

```bash
zrb devtool install tmux
```

# Setup Pyenv

With pyenv, you can manage multiple python environments.
Installing pyenv is highly recommended.

You can install pyenv by invoking the following command:

```bash
zrb devtool install pyenv
```

# Setup Nvm

Nvm allows you to manage multiple node.js environments. Node.js is mandatory if you want to run `fastapp` application.

You can install nvm by invoking the following command:

```bash
zrb devtool install nvm
```

# Setup Docker and Kubectl

If you are using WSL, the most recommended way is by installing docker desktop and enable wsl-integration

Otherwise, you can invoke the following command:

```bash
zrb devtool install docker
zrb devtool install kubectl
```

# Setup Pulumi

To setup pulumi, you can invoke the following command:

```bash
zrb devtool install pulumi
```

You need pulumi for app deployment.

# Setup Other Tools

There are some other tools you might need to install depending on your needs. For example:

- Helm
- Aws CLI
- GCloud CLI
- GVM
- SDKMAN
- Terraform

You can install those tools by invoking the following commands:

```
zrb devtool install helm
zrb devtool install aws
zrb devtool install gcloud
zrb devtool install gvm
zrb devtool install sdkman
zrb devtool install terraform
```
