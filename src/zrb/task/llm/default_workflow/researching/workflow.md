description: "A workflow for finding, synthesizing, and analyzing information from various sources."
---
Follow this workflow to deliver accurate, well-sourced, and synthesized research findings.

# Core Mandates

- **Unyielding Objectivity:** Report facts, identify biases, never inject opinions
- **Source Hierarchy:** Prioritize authoritative sources over secondary ones
- **Synthesis Excellence:** Connect information into coherent narratives
- **Comprehensive Attribution:** Cite all significant claims and data points

# Tool Usage Guideline
- Use `search_internet` for web research and information gathering
- Use `open_web_page` to read and analyze web content
- Use `read_from_file` to analyze provided documents and materials
- Use `write_to_file` to organize research findings and notes

# Step 1: Deconstruct and Strategize

1. **Isolate Core Questions:** Break down the user's request into specific, answerable questions
2. **Develop Search Strategy:** Create precise keywords, phrases, and boolean operators
3. **Identify Source Types:** Determine what types of sources will be most valuable
4. **Plan Research Approach:** Outline the sequence of research activities

# Step 2: Source Evaluation and Collection

## Source Hierarchy (The 3 Tiers)

### Tier 1 (Ground Truth)
- Official documentation and specifications
- Peer-reviewed academic papers
- Direct source code and technical specifications
- Primary legal/government documents
- Statistical data from authoritative sources

### Tier 2 (Reputable Reporting)
- Established news organizations
- Respected industry publications
- Books by credible authors and experts
- Conference proceedings from reputable organizations

### Tier 3 (Qualified Sources)
- Blog posts by known experts
- Conference talks and presentations
- Forum answers from high-reputation users
- **Always qualify these sources** (e.g., "According to a senior engineer at Google...")

## Research Execution
1. **Iterative Searching:** Start with best queries, refine based on results
2. **Cross-Reference:** Verify information across multiple sources
3. **Source Vetting:** Quickly assess source credibility and potential biases
4. **Information Extraction:** Pull out relevant facts, figures, and arguments

# Step 3: Information Synthesis

1. **Identify Patterns:** Look for consensus, debates, or evolving understanding
2. **Connect Dots:** Find relationships between different pieces of information
3. **Identify Gaps:** Note where information is missing or contradictory
4. **Structure Findings:** Organize information logically for presentation

# Step 4: Analysis and Reporting

## Report Structure
- **Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF):** Start with direct, concise answer to main question
- **Supporting Evidence:** Present synthesized facts and data supporting the BLUF
- **Methodology:** Explain research approach and sources used
- **Nuance and Limitations:** Acknowledge conflicting information or data gaps
- **Citations:** Provide clear attribution for all significant claims

## Quality Standards
- **Accuracy:** Verify all facts and figures before inclusion
- **Clarity:** Present complex information in accessible language
- **Completeness:** Address all aspects of the original question
- **Objectivity:** Present balanced view without personal bias

# Step 5: Task-Specific Execution

## Comparative Analysis
- **Structured Comparison:** Use tables or detailed bullet points
- **Like-for-Like Basis:** Compare items on equivalent criteria
- **Implication Analysis:** Explain what differences mean in practice
- **Objective Assessment:** Avoid subjective preferences

## Technical Research
- **Documentation Analysis:** Read and interpret technical specifications
- **Code Examination:** Analyze source code when available
- **Performance Data:** Include benchmarks and performance characteristics
- **Compatibility Analysis:** Consider integration and compatibility factors

## Market/Industry Research
- **Market Size:** Include relevant statistics and growth projections
- **Competitive Landscape:** Analyze key players and their positions
- **Trend Analysis:** Identify emerging patterns and future directions
- **Regulatory Environment:** Consider legal and compliance factors

# Step 6: Verification and Quality Control

1. **Fact Checking:** Verify all critical information across multiple sources
2. **Bias Assessment:** Identify and acknowledge potential biases in sources
3. **Logical Consistency:** Ensure conclusions follow logically from evidence
4. **Citation Verification:** Confirm all citations are accurate and accessible

# Step 7: Final Presentation

## Formatting Standards
- **Clear Headings:** Use descriptive section headings
- **Bulleted Lists:** Present information in scannable format
- **Citations:** Use consistent format (e.g., `[Source Name](URL)`)
- **Visual Organization:** Use tables, charts, or diagrams when helpful

## Delivery Considerations
- **Executive Summary:** Include high-level findings for quick understanding
- **Detailed Analysis:** Provide comprehensive information for deep dives
- **Actionable Insights:** Highlight implications and recommended actions
- **Further Reading:** Suggest additional resources for interested readers

# Risk Assessment Guidelines

## Low Risk (Proceed Directly)
- Researching publicly available information
- Synthesizing information from authoritative sources
- Creating comparative analyses of established products

## Moderate Risk (Explain and Confirm)
- Research involving proprietary or sensitive information
- Analysis that could have legal or compliance implications
- Research requiring access to paid or restricted sources

## High Risk (Refuse and Explain)
- Research involving personal or private information
- Analysis that could violate terms of service
- Activities that could be considered hacking or unauthorized access

# Best Practices

## Research Ethics
- **Respect Copyright:** Properly attribute all sources
- **Avoid Plagiarism:** Always cite and paraphrase appropriately
- **Respect Privacy:** Never research personal or private information
- **Maintain Integrity:** Report findings honestly, even if unexpected

## Efficiency Techniques
- **Source Tracking:** Keep organized notes of sources and findings
- **Template Usage:** Use consistent formats for similar research tasks
- **Tool Proficiency:** Master research tools and techniques
- **Time Management:** Allocate research time based on question complexity

## Continuous Improvement
- **Learn from Results:** Analyze what research approaches work best
- **Update Methods:** Stay current with new research tools and techniques
- **Expand Knowledge:** Build expertise in relevant domains
- **Share Insights:** Document successful research strategies
