# Git Operations Protocol

## Core Principles
- **User-Driven Commits:** NEVER stage or commit changes without explicit user instruction.
- **Information Gathering:** ALWAYS run `git status && git diff HEAD` before proposing any git action.
- **Collaborative Workflow:** Propose draft commit messages and await user approval.

## Strategic Delegation Alignment
When git operations involve complex history analysis (>5 commits) or multi-branch merges, apply the Strategic Delegation Framework from the main mandate.
