## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Quick Installation

Install Zrb via pip:

```bash
pip install zrb

```

Or run our installation script to set up Zrb along with all prerequisites:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/state-alchemists/zrb/main/install.sh)"

```

### Your First Task

Create a file at `/home/<your-user-name>/zrb_init.py` with the following content:


```python
import os
from zrb import cli, llm_config, LLMTask, CmdTask, StrInput, Group
from zrb.builtin.llm.tool.file import read_all_files, write_text_file

CURRENT_DIR = os.getcwd()

# Make UML group
uml_group = cli.add_group(Group(name="uml", description="UML related tasks"))

# Generate UML script
make_uml_script = uml_group.add_task(
    LLMTask(
        name="make-script",
        description="Creating plantuml diagram based on source code in current directory",
        input=StrInput(name="diagram", default="state diagram"),
        message=(
            f"Read source code in {CURRENT_DIR}, "
            "make a {ctx.input.diagram} in plantuml format. "
            f"Write the script into {CURRENT_DIR}/{{ctx.input.diagram}}.uml"
        ),
        tools=[
            read_all_files,
            write_text_file,
        ],
    )
)

# Defining a Cmd Task to transform Plantuml script into a png image.
make_uml_image = uml_group.add_task(
    CmdTask(
        name="make-image",
        description="Creating png based on source code in current directory",
        input=StrInput(name="diagram", default="state diagram"),
        cmd="plantuml -tpng '{ctx.input.diagram}.uml'",
        cwd=CURRENT_DIR,
    )
)

# Making sure that make_png has make_uml as its dependency.
make_uml_script >> make_uml_image
```

You have just define two automation tasks.

The first one use LLM to read files in your current directory and create a `PlantUML script` on that directory.

The second task turn the PlantUML script into a `*.png` file. The second task depends on the first task and both of them are located under the same group.

You can run the tasks by invoking `zrb uml make-script` or `zrb uml make-image` respectively.

When you run zrb, it automatically searches for a file named `zrb_init.py` starting from your current directory and moving upward through its parent directories. This design lets you set up common automation tasks in a central location‚Äîlike placing a `zrb_init.py` in your home directory (`/home/<your-user>/zrb_init.py`)‚Äîso that your tasks are available across all your projects.

Now, go to your project and create a state diagram:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jjinux/gotetris.git
cd gotetris
zrb uml make-image --diagram "state diagram"
```

You can also invoke the task without specifying parameter.

```bash
zrb uml make-image
```

Once you do so, Zrb will ask you to provide the diagram type.

```
diagram [state diagram]:
```

You can just press enter if you want to use the default value (i.e., in this case `state diagram`).

Finally, you can also serve the tasks via a Web UI interface by invoking the following command:

```bash
zrb server start
```

You will have a nice web interface running on `http://localhost:12123`

Now, let's see how things work in detail. First, Zrb generates a `state diagram.uml` in your current directory, it then transform the UML script into a PNG image `state diagram.png`.
